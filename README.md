What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?
ans) get element by id means searching the related whick i can manipulate exact id content
      get element by class name means all type of class i gave , i can manipulate acoording to their class name. in that case i have to ensure to get all class by making for loop.
